    "We recently launched a new measure of [seven day prescribing for long term conditions](https://openprescribing.net/measure/seven_day_prescribing/all-england/) where we found variation across the country. In the background we state that there is no consensus on duration of long term prescriptions and guidance varies throughout the country around stable long term prescriptions. Most CCGs will have some form of guidance generally for one, two or three months. \n",

    "The University of Bristol have produced a [policy briefing](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/policybristol/policy-briefings/repeat-prescription-costs/) arguing that three month repeat prescriptions are more cost-effective. They base this on a systematic review and studies in CPRD. \n",
    "\n",
    "I have had a quick skim of the systematic review (based exclusively on American data) and the CPRD study. The policy briefing states that _current guidance to issue 28-day repeat prescriptions_. This deviates from the DataLab assertion in the seven days measure that there is no consensus. Martin, Payne and Wilson study is is based on old guidance from a handful of areas. This notebook seeks to ascertain what the variation is in 28 v 56 v 84 across the country for our basket of medicines commonly prescribed once daily for long term conditions on the complete prescribing dataset for England."
